In order to make the application functional it is nessercery to make a pgAdmin database named "Destinations". 

The data for this database can be found in Station.shp, which is in the main folder.

Since we had different passwords for PGadmin it is also nessercery to create a password file: "password.py"

The content of this file should be:

  kode = "Enter your pgAdmin password here"
